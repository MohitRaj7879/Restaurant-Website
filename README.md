# Restaurant-Website
This is a college project.

The objective of creating a restaurant website is to establish a strong online presence, attract potential customers, and enhance the overall dining experience. Through visually appealing design, easy navigation, and showcasing the menu, promotions, and contact information, the website aims to drive engagement, increase reservations, and ultimately boost restaurant revenue

I am not providing the images and videos used in this project.
